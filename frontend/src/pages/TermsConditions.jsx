          <h3>5.1 Property Information</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Property listings are provided by third-party agents, owners, and partners</li>
            <li>We do our best to ensure accuracy, but property details can change</li>
            <li>Property prices, availability, and details are subject to change without notice</li>
            <li>Always verify property information independently before making any decisions</li>
            <li>We reserve the right to remove listings that violate our content policies</li>
          </ul>
          <div className="casual-note">
            <p>Basically... We connect you with great properties, but always double-check the details with the agent or owner before making any commitments.</p>
          </div>

          <h3>5.2 Property Verification and Due Diligence</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>What "Verified" means:</strong> Our verification badges indicate we've done preliminary document checks - think of it as a helpful first step, not the final word</li>
            <li><strong>Your responsibility:</strong> You should still conduct your own legal verification, title searches, and property inspections before any transaction</li>
            <li><strong>Use professionals:</strong> We strongly recommend engaging qualified lawyers, surveyors, and other professionals for final property verification</li>
            <li><strong>Our limits:</strong> We're not liable for losses or disputes arising from property transactions, including title defects or fraudulent documentation</li>
            <li>Our verification process includes document review, but doesn't replace professional legal advice</li>
          </ul>
          <div className="casual-note">
            <p>Basically... Our "Verified" badge means we've done some homework on the property, but you should still do your own due diligence with a lawyer before buying.</p>
          </div>

          <h3>5.3 Property Transaction Disclaimer</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>LOFT STUDIO connects buyers, sellers, and agents - we're the platform, not the middleman</li>
            <li>All negotiations, contracts, and payments happen directly between you and the other party</li>
            <li>You're responsible for your own property transaction decisions</li>
            <li>We recommend working with qualified legal and financial professionals</li>
          </ul>
          <div className="casual-note">
            <p>Basically... We're like the venue where you meet - the actual deal happens between you and the seller/agent.</p>

            <li><strong>We do our best, but we're not perfect:</strong> LOFT STUDIO won't be liable for losses or claims arising from our property verification services, even if we make mistakes</li>
            <li><strong>What verification covers:</strong> Our verification process is limited to document review and basic due diligence checks - it's not comprehensive legal or financial analysis</li>
            <li><strong>Sophisticated fraud happens:</strong> We're not liable for sophisticated fraud, forged documents, or misrepresentation by third parties that might fool our verification</li>
            <li><strong>Title issues:</strong> We don't guarantee clear title, proper ownership, or absence of encumbrances - you need independent title searches</li>
            <li><strong>Maximum exposure:</strong> Our total liability won't exceed KES 100,000 or the amount you paid us in the past 12 months, whichever is less</li>
